We all know about Tuki and Jha. Two greatest astronaut in the history of humankind. Recently they got a call from NASA.
 NASA wants to send them on a very secret mission. It's all about a mysterious planet. NASA wants to explore that planet. 
So, they sent Tuki, Jha and Robi ( Not Robi sim. It's a stupid robot) to do that. 

Now, after reaching the planet they want to say hello to that planet.
 But alas! they can't remember the name
of the planet. 
I told you about that stupid robot Robi. right? 
That robot hit their head with a hammer for some reason. That's the reason of their memory loss.


All they know that the name of this planet is a positive integer greater than 0. 
Now, your task is to help Tuki and Jha. 
Undoubtedly, they are the greatest astronaut in the history of humankind but not that good at programming. 
You already printed "Hello world!" in your ugly looking small black console. 
Now, do that again. But this time, not the world.  


It's time say hello to another planet.






Input : (this is the only input you don't have to consider any other inputs)
1

Output :
Hello X!
(Where X is the name of this planet.)


Hints :

1. There is a similarity between the current most junior batch of SUST and this planet.

2. Never give up. Some wrong submissions don't matter that much. right?  
And obviously, we want you to solve that problem. So, the answer is not in long distance.
